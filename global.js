//The Global Object
//In Node the global object isn't called 'window' like in the browser but rather called 'global'.
//  console.log(global);
//Just like in the window, we don't have to type in global.(method) we can simply write the method name and it will woek just like below.
//  setTimeout(() => {
//     console.log('in the timeout');
//     clearInterval(int);
//  }, 3000);

//  const int = setInterval(() => {
// console.log('in the interval')
//  }, 1000);

//  console.log(__dirname); //this property gets us the absolute path the folder is in.
//  console.log(__filename); //this propety gets us the absolute path the folder is in with the filename included.
